# Dive into React

## What is React?
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was created by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.

## What is a component?
In React, a component is a reusable piece of UI that can be composed together with other components to create complex UIs. Components can be thought of as building blocks that make up the UI of a React application. Each component has its own state and can receive input in the form of props, which are passed down from its parent component.

## How do we make a React element a DOM element?
The data flow in React is unidirectional, meaning that data flows in a single direction from the parent component to its children. When a parent component's state changes, it passes down the new state to its children as props. Children components can also pass data back up to their parent components through callback functions.

## How do we make a React element a DOM element?
